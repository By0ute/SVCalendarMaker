# SVCalendarMaker

## Tiny software for SV Schedule
As an [**ACM Siggraph**](http://www.siggraph.org/) [**Student Volunteer**](http://www.siggraphstudentvolunteers.com/), I had shifts to do that I can check online. In order to have my tasks calendar offline, I made this to convert the webpage in an iCalendar to load on my smartphone.

## How does it work?
